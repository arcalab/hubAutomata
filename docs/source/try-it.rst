    Lightweight vs Server mode

While the toolset is developed in Scala, the code is compiled both into *JVM*
binaries that are executed on a **server**, and into **JavaScript** using
`ScalaJS <https://wwws.scala- js.org>`_ to produce an interactive web page.

Both versions provide *almost* the same functionality, with the server
additionally supporting the live verification of properties through the Uppaal model checker.
Everything else apart from the live verification is computed
by the browser using the generated JavaScript libraries.
