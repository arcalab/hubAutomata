# Hubs for VirtuosoNext™ [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/hubs/badge/?version=latest)](https://hubs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


Hubs for VirtuosoNext™ is a web-based toolset to build, compose, depict, and analyse
**Timed Hub Automata**.
These automata give semantics to *Hubs*,
interacting entities on the Real-Time operating system **VirtuosoNext™**
developed by [Altreonic](http://www.altreonic.com/).
Hubs act as synchronisation and communication mechanisms between the application
tasks and implement the services provided by the kernel
as a kind of Guarded Protected Action with a well defined semantics.

The toolset is developed in Scala, and uses ScalaJS to generate JavaScript.
The toolset is developed as a sub-module of [ReoLive](https://github.com/ReoLanguage/ReoLive).
